•JS is different from JAVA

•JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

•JS can be executed in 3 ways
	1. web browser
	2. <script> tag
	3. using a runtime (Node.js)
	
•JS is dynamic type language i.e data types to variables are assigned at runtime rather than compile time as done with static type(ex:cpp,JAVA). 

•RULES FOR DECLARING VARIABLES:
	1. should start with '$', '_' or letter.
	2. case sensitive
	
	
•"var" declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped
•"var" can be updated/re-declared


•"let" is block scoped
•'let' can be updated but not re-declared.
