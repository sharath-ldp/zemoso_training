•JS is different from JAVA

•JS can be executed in 3 ways
	1. web browser
	2. <script> tag
	3. using a runtime (Node.js)
	
•JS is dynamic type language i.e data types to variables are assigned at runtime rather than compile time as done with static type(ex:cpp,JAVA). 

•RULES FOR DECLARING VARIABLES:
	1. should start with '$', '_' or letter.
	2. case sensitive
	
	
•"var" declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped
•"var" can be updated/re-declared


•"let" is block scoped
•'let' can be updated but not re-declared.


•Variables declared with the const maintain constant values.
•"const" declarations are block scoped 
•"const" cannot be updated or re-declared
